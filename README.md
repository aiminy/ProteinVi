# ProteinVi

As the development of the technolgy for determining macromolecule structures, biologists need some software to visualize the macromolecule structure they are interested. The ability to visualize the 3D structure of is critical in many areas like, drug design, protein modeling.For this reason, we develop a protein structure visualization tool.
